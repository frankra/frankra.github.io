experiences:
  - role: Senior Software Engineer
    company: SAP SE (Business Process Intelligence)
    from: 03/2021
    to: Present
    location: Berlin, Germany
    description: SAP's Integrated Business Suite of different applications that allows non-developers to design, run and monitor custom business processes.
    activities:
      - description: Started the infrastructure as code initiative in the team, where using mainly terraform, we were able to automate and substantially improve the provisioning and maintenance of our landscapes.
      - description: Worked on the multitenancy enablement of the integrated suite which handled the onboarding and offboarding of new tenants and kafka topics. Also worked on the strategy to notify kafka listeners to subscribe to newly created topics, regardless of the amount of listener replicas.

    location: Berlin, Germany
    description: Ruum is a lightweight process and projects management tool which allows users to map and execute simple business processes as well as define small projects and coordinate teams and timelines.
    activities:
      - description: Contributed to both frontend and backend development. This helped the team to be more agile as I could easily switch contexts and also helped to refine the API designs for a better development experience on the frontend.
      - description: Implemented the OData framework to speed up and optimize the development of new public and internal APIs. To add new entities, developers would only need to annotate existing TypeORM entites with the OData Framework annotations, then the rest would be handled automatically, including filtering, pagination, navigation and metadata generation.
      - description: Worked on the peformance optimization of the OData framework queries, leveraging Postgres Lateral Joins for pagination on entities with expanded properties, substantially improving the API performance without limiting its functionality.
      - description: Performed load tests on the API framework and system infrastructure to measure the performance impact and resilience. Also implemented the request rate limitation policy to protect the infrastructure against DDoS attacks.
      - description: Implemented the webhooks system allowing integration developers to register their applications, track and debug the webhook events and re-send failed events. This improved a lot the experience of integration developers.
